### Imagine if each of us had the freedom to define life on our own terms...

- We control our **identity**. Each of us decide who we are and how we present
  ourselves to the world.
- We have **true ownership**. We are in control of our personal information and
  belongings - where and how they are kept, and who we share them with.
- We have complete freedom to choose who we **trust** and **collaborate** with.
- We communicate **freely** and **privately** without being monitored.
- Each of us have **equal opportunity** to make an impact.
- We **respect** and **take care** of each other and the world that we live in.

👋 Hey, I'm Chris. By helping to build the tools that we need to **thrive in a
free society**, I hope to contribute to this vision of the future.
